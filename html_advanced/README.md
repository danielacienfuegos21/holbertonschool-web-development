# HTML Structure Project

## Overview

This project marks the starting point of a series of web development exercises focused on building a complete webpage from a professional design file.  
For this first stage, the objective is to develop the **HTML structure only**, without adding any CSS or JavaScript.  
The emphasis is on writing **clean, semantic, and accessible HTML**, accurately representing the hierarchy and organization of the page as defined in the design.

This project serves as the foundation for upcoming phases, where visual styling and interactivity will be progressively implemented.  
By isolating the HTML layer, I aim to strengthen my understanding of how to structure content logically and meaningfully before applying any presentation rules.

## Project Description

The task involves translating the visual structure of the design into semantic HTML elements.  
This includes defining the global page structure (header, navigation, main content, and footer) as well as identifying sections, articles, headings, and other relevant tags to ensure the document’s readability and accessibility.

No visual styles are applied at this stage — all effort is directed toward **creating a robust structural skeleton** that can later support CSS and JavaScript enhancements.  

Key aspects of the implementation include:

- Consistent and meaningful use of **HTML5 semantic tags**  
- Proper nesting and indentation for readability  
- Logical hierarchy of headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.)  
- Placeholder text and media elements reflecting the original layout  
- Clean, well-commented code to facilitate later styling and maintenance

## Deliverables

- A single file named `index.html` containing:
  - The complete page structure as defined in Figma
  - Correct use of semantic HTML5 elements
  - Placeholder content matching the design

---

## Next Steps

In the upcoming project stage, the focus will shift to **styling the page using CSS**, applying layout rules, typography, and responsive design principles.  
This will build upon the solid HTML foundation established here, ensuring that the visual design is both faithful to the Figma file and adaptable across devices.
