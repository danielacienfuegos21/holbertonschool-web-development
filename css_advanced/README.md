# Webpage Styling Project 🎨  

This project is the continuation of my previous work **“HTML, Advanced”**, where I built the complete HTML structure of a webpage from scratch.  
Now, the focus is on **CSS and styling** —bringing structure, color, and hierarchy to create a cohesive and visually appealing design.  

---

## 📄 Overview  

The main objective of this project is to transform the static HTML layout into a fully styled and responsive webpage that matches the reference design provided in **Figma**.  
Every element —from spacing and alignment to typography and proportions— will be implemented with precision while maintaining clean and organized code.

## ⚙️ Project Structure  

The starting point is the existing HTML file from *“0x02. HTML, advanced”*, ensuring that all previous tasks are completed before adding CSS.  

---

## 🧠 Objectives  

- Apply consistent and semantic **CSS styling** to the existing HTML structure.  
- Ensure the design is **responsive** and visually aligned with the Figma layout.  
- Recreate accurate spacing, color palettes, and typography.  
- Maintain a clean, readable, and scalable codebase.

## 🧩 Notes  

- Some Figma values might be in decimals —you can round them when necessary.  
- Make sure all HTML tasks from the previous project are fully completed before starting this one.
